# Attention-augmented-Convolutional-Neural-Networks
As part of my research on creating attention based modules for improving accuracies on Computer Vision-tasks this is a initial experimental code that i have done 
I am utilizing the idea of self attention mechanism form the 2017 paper that states attention is all you need.
More detailed Code with explanation will be made availale  soon as our experiments conclude.
